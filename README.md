![](images/CI_CD_Pipeline.png)
The **Devops Final Project** is the final project as part of the DevOps training program at [Eazytraining](https://eazytraining.fr/) school. Its goal is to provide both a practical and theoretical demonstration of the technical skills acquired during the DevOps Bootcamp, including **Docker**, **GitLab CI**, **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Kubernetes**.

In this project, I implemented a comprehensive solution that includes:

- Containerization of applications.
- Setting up a CI/CD pipeline.
- Deploying applications on AWS ec2 using Ansible and docker-compose.

The applications involved are:
- **Odoo**: A multifunctional ERP used for enterprise management.
- **PgAdmin**: A graphical tool for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **Ic-webapp**: A showcase website chich is containerized for easier deployment and management.

This project also demonstrates the integration of various tools and technologies to achieve automation, scalability, and efficient application deployment.
